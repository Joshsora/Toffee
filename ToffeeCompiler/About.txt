What is ToffeeCompiler?
=======================================

ToffeeCompiler is a utility to convert .tdl ("Toffee Definition Language") files
into source code that can be used by Toffee libraries.

How does it work?
=======================================

ToffeeCompiler takes two files as input, a .tdl file, and a .tofc file.
The .tdl file contains the definitions of structures, objects, and services
that can reside on any Toffee network that also implements them.
The .tofc file defines the patterns of the output language.

The .tofc is internally supplied data via a ToffeeDataGatherer.

For more information on both TDL, and TOFC, please read the documentation here:

/Toffee/Documentation/TOFC Syntax.txt

Example Usage
=======================================

To run the example, execute the following command:
ToffeeCompiler csharp Example/Test/Test.tdl -OutputDirectory Output/
